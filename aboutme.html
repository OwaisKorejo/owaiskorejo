			<h1 id = "subheading">About Me</h1>
			<p id = "description"> I am a 15 year old from Pakistan who loves to code. Although I am from Pakistan, I have spent most of my life in Ireland, where we moved in 2013. I went to St. Olaf's National School for my primary school. I am currently attending Stepaisde Educate Together Secondary School as a Transition Year student. </P>

			<p id = "description"> When I was 7 years old, I loved to play Minecraft on my XBOX ONE. At the age of 8, I was introduced to "Minecraft Mods", and shortly after I stumbled across coding. I was interested as to what it was, so I dug further and discovered web development. I went to the Academy of Code in Oatlands College, where I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS.</P>
			<br>
			<p id = "description"> After one year, I left the academy, but I still enjoyed web developement, so I went on W3Schools and learnt from there. I soon graduated from primary school, and went to SETSS. I stopped programming for 3 years. I returned to it in 2021, when I built my first PC, and learnt C++ from HackerRank. HackerRank was recommended to me from my coding teacher. I then later found myself watching a William Lin video, where he wins Google Kickstart. This led me to competitive programming, which is something that I have been doing for the last 3 months.</P>
